                description: |-
                  Use this structure to allow cryptographic operations (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations)
                  in the grant only when the operation request includes the specified encryption
                  context (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context).

                  KMS applies the grant constraints only to cryptographic operations that support
                  an encryption context, that is, all cryptographic operations with a symmetric
                  KMS key (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#symmetric-cmks).
                  Grant constraints are not applied to operations that do not support an encryption
                  context, such as cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys and management
                  operations, such as DescribeKey or RetireGrant.

                  In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption operation
                  must be an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and values in the encryption
                  context of the encryption operation. Only the order of the pairs can vary.

                  However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not case
                  sensitive, but the value is case sensitive.

                  To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that differ
                  only by case. To require a fully case-sensitive encryption context, use the
                  kms:EncryptionContext: and kms:EncryptionContextKeys conditions in an IAM
                  or key policy. For details, see kms:EncryptionContext: (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-encryption-context)
