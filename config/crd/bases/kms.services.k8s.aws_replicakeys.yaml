                  The key policy to attach to the KMS key. This parameter is optional. If you
                  do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches the default key policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default)
                  to the KMS key.

                  The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify
                  the same key policy or a different key policy for each key in a set of related
                  multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this property.

                  If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

                     * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent
                     PutKeyPolicy request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS
                     key becomes unmanageable. For more information, see Default key policy
                     (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html#prevent-unmanageable-key)
                     in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. (To omit this condition,
                     set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true.)

                     * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals.
                     The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to KMS. When
                     you create a new Amazon Web Services principal, you might need to enforce
                     a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the
                     new principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information,
                     see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency)
                     in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide.

                  A key policy document can include only the following characters:

                     * Printable ASCII characters from the space character (\u0020) through
                     the end of the ASCII character range.

                     * Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character
                     set (through \u00FF).

                     * The tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) special
                     characters

                  Amazon Web Services General Reference.

                  HMAC KMS keys are not supported in all Amazon Web Services Regions. If you
                  try to replicate an HMAC KMS key in an Amazon Web Services Region in which
                  HMAC keys are not supported, the ReplicateKey operation returns an UnsupportedOperationException.
                  For a list of Regions in which HMAC KMS keys are supported, see HMAC keys
                  in KMS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html)
                  in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

                  The replica must be in a different Amazon Web Services Region than its primary
                  key and other replicas of that primary key, but in the same Amazon Web Services
                  partition. KMS must be available in the replica Region. If the Region is
                  not enabled by default, the Amazon Web Services account must be enabled in
                  the Region. For information about Amazon Web Services partitions, see Amazon
                  Resource Names (ARNs) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)

                  operation.

                  Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This
                  field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

                  Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key.
                  For details, see ABAC for KMS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html)
                  in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

                  To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html)
                  permission in an IAM policy.

                  Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the
                  same tags or different tags for each key in a set of related multi-Region
                  keys. KMS does not synchronize this property.

                  Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the
                  tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string.
                  You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same tag key. If
                  you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, KMS replaces
                  the current tag value with the specified one.

                  When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web Services
                  generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags.
                  Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For details, see Tagging
                  Keys (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html).
